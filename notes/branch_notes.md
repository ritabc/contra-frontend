* **fix-master-for-demos** 
    - created 10/6/2019
    - intention was to fix heartbeat contra to be shown in master
    - for now decision was to continue with previous branch *prog-not-necessarily-last*. The animation is buggy, but it works
        - And if a major refactoring will happen soon, it won't matter anyways that the animation is buggy 
* **master** 
    - if return to master, change 'dance-composition' to 'dance-moves-info'
