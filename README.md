# Contra Visualizer
## By Rita Bennett-Chew
An in-progress application with the ultimate goal of visualizing contra dances in motion. Utilizes a [Rails API](https://github.com/ritabc/contra-api) which stores data on dances, moves, positions, etc.
Ultimately, a user will be able to log in, draft and save a dance, and select a dance to visualize. Dances will be composed of: starting formation, first move, ending position of that move, second move, ending position of that move, ... last move, ending position of that move.

## Future Goals
1. Deploy
- Secure Rails API and host
- Deploy Angular Frontend

1. Compose a dance from web, add it to the db (Up A pickle?)
1. Code for progression (for Heartbeat)
1. Google OAuth
1. Brainstorm and research color/visualization schemes for more accessible color combinations
1. Media queries
1. Addition of button/form to submit requests for edits/additions of moves/positions, feature requests, or general feedback

## Technologies Used
1. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.
2. This project uses the [GreenSock Animation Platform](https://greensock.com/) to compose choreographed dance animations

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
